      <h3>About Rose</h3>
      
      <p>
        Rose is an imperative programming language which is intended to be scalable (like Scala), nice to read (like Ruby)
        and intuitive and powerful (like Python). It's also trying to be different, and so it doesn't do the things in
        traditional way.

      <h3>Philosophy</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Long and nice is better than short and fast but ugly.</li>
        <li>Things shouldn't get silently by. Errors should be suppressed only explicitly.</li>
        <li>Flat is better than nested.</li>
        <li>Size of file is the second thing after readability of long lines (see 1).</li>
        <li>No special cases. Just follow the rules. Trust me, they're very benevolent.</li>
        <li>There is only one - the nicest, shortest, fastest, somethingest - way to do something.</li>
        <li>It's bad idea if you can't explain it easy.</li>
      </ul>
