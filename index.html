      <h3>About Rose</h3>
      
      <p>
        Rose is an imperative programming language which is intended to be scalable (like Scala), nice to read (like Ruby)
        and intuitive and powerful (like Python). It's also trying to be different, and so it doesn't do the things in
        traditional way.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Take a look...
      </p>
      
      <h3>Philosophy</h3>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Long and nice is better than short and fast but ugly.</li>
        <li>Things shouldn't get silently by. Errors should be suppressed only explicitly.</li>
        <li>Flat is better than nested.</li>
        <li>Size of file is the second thing after readability of long lines (see 1).</li>
        <li>No special cases. Just follow the rules. Trust me, they're very benevolent.</li>
        <li>There is only one - the nicest, shortest, fastest, somethingest - way to do something.</li>
        <li>It's bad idea if you can't explain it easy.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Basic syntax</h3>
      
      <p>
        Syntax is very obvious, it looks like Python. Blocks are indented by <em>3 whitespaces</em>. And just and only with 3 whatespaces.
        Functions without parameters need to have empty parenthesis (this will probably change). Rose has macros (expression and block).
        You can transform operators into functions (like in Ruby, but a bit differently).

      <pre class="code">
print("Hello world!")  # => "Hello world!"

PI = 3.14159  # PI!!float


# Rose is dynamic

a = 1  # a!!int
a = "Foo!"  # a!!str
a = 'a'  # a!!chr

if a!!bool:  # Type check
  print("`a` is a boolean!")

else:
  print(a.cls.__name__)  # Object has reference to its class. Class has a reference to its name.

print(q["Hello world!"])  # Expression macro - quasiquote, => something like "node.str(v: "Hello world!")"

error:  # Block macro - error. Raises error if the first expression is true.
  PI == 3

  "PI can't be 3!"

assert:  # Same as above. Raises error if the first expression is false.
  PI != 3

  "PI can't be 3!"

def foo(bar, baz=3):  # Function. Last argument is optional/default.
  print(bar * baz)  # This function returns `nil`. The last expression is returned.

  pass  # This "hack" does not work. `pass`es are automatically trimmed. They're used only for parsing.

foo("Hello ")  # => "Hello Hello Hello "
foo(3, 9)  # => "27", function arguments are dynamic. You will be probably able to change this explicitly.
           # Maybe, it will look like `def foo(arg!!str)` or something like this...

# Have I said that Rose should be different?
# Yes, and the difference is in the object model (or at least in object creation).

def Person(@name, @age):  # Required keyword - non-positional - arguments
  @{name: @name, age: @age}  # Syntatic sugar for object creation.

# So it's just a function returning a dictionary.
# This will probably change, because the interpreter will need to add fields like `cls` and `to_s` and so on...
# But I like this concept.
